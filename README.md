# Melanoma Cancer Detection Interface Using Deep Learning

## 🧠 Overview
This project is a web-based application designed to assist healthcare professionals and individuals in detecting melanoma, a serious form of skin cancer. By leveraging advanced deep learning models, the system analyzes skin lesion images to predict the likelihood of melanoma, aiming to facilitate early detection and treatment.

## 🚀 Features

- **AI-Powered Melanoma Detection** Utilizes convolutional neural networks (CNNs) trained on dermatological image datasets to identify potential melanoma case.
- **User-Friendly Interface** A clean and intuitive web interface for uploading images and viewing result.
- **Educational Resources** Provides information on melanoma prevention, symptoms, and treatment option.
- **Secure Data Handling** Ensures user data privacy with secure image handling and no storage of personal dat.
- **Responsive Design** Accessible across various devices, including desktops, tablets, and smartphone.
